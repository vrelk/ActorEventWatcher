# AI Event Watcher for MinAi
[Actor Event Details](vrelk_ActorWatcherEffectScript.md)\
[Better Vampires Turned NPC Feed Event](magicAttachAshPileOnVampireDeathNPC.md)

 - If you are using Better Vampires... (`magicAttachAshPileOnVampireDeathNPC` script)
	 - If you are NOT using Race Compatibility, you will need the script located in the `BV-9.01` folder.
	 - If you are using Race Compatibility 2.16, you will need the script in the `RaceCompat-2.16` folder.

#### Make sure this mod has a higher priority than both *Better Vampires* and *Race Compatibility* in your mod manager so it can override the Better Vampires script.
